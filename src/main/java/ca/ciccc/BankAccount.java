     * The transactionFee method accepts a fee amount ({@code double}) as a parameter, and applies that fee
     * to the user's past transactions. The fee is applied once for the first transaction, twice for
     * the second transaction, three times for the third, and so on. These fees are subtracted out
     * from the user's overall balance. If the user's balance is large enough to afford all of the
     * fees with greater than $0.00 remaining, the method will return {@code true}. If the balance cannot
     * afford all of the fees or has no money left, the balance is left as 0.0 and method returns
     * {@code false}.
     *
     * For example, given the following ca.ciccc.BankAccount object.
